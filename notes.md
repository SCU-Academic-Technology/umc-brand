# Brand site v2

Old one requires manual updates and it's getting really annoying updating it manually

How can I use a sample scu.edu webpage to fetch the code to dynamically generate the code?

I can have html ID's for each content type

## Inspo
https://t4.scu.edu/terminalfour/page/section#edit/1138

Plan:
* create a temp section with id that corresponds
